# Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and learning materials on various topics.

## What's Inside

**Git:** Version control basics and workflows  
**Azure:** Cloud services and deployment notes  
**Networking:** Protocols, configurations, and troubleshooting  
**Additional Topics:** New subjects as I learn them  

## How I Use This Repo

I organize notes by topic in separate folders. Each folder contains:

- Key concepts and definitions
- Code examples and commands
- Links to helpful resources
- Practice exercises and solutions

## Why I Made This

Learning happens best when I write things down and can reference them later. This repo helps me:

- Track my progress across different subjects
- Build a personal knowledge base
- Share what I've learned with others

## Getting Started

Browse the folders to see what topics I'm currently studying. Feel free to explore and use any notes that help you learn too.
