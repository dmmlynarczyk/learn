## Lab 09a: Azure Web Apps - Foundation for Cloud Resume Challenge

**What This Lab Taught Me**:
Learning to configure web apps with GitHub repository integration, deployment slots for staging/production workflows, and autoscaling for handling traffic changes - exactly what I'll need for my cloud resume project.

**Cloud Resume Challenge Connections**:
- **GitHub Integration**: Configured the web app to display content from an external GitHub repository - this is how I'll deploy my resume website
- **Staging Workflows**: Created staging slot and practiced swapping with production - means I can test changes before they go live
- **Autoscaling**: Learning how to handle traffic spikes automatically (important if my resume gets shared widely!)

**Professional Development Workflow I Learned**:
- **Safe Deployments**: Test changes in staging, then swap to production when ready
- **Rollback Capability**: If something breaks, I can quickly swap back to the previous version
- **Automated Scaling**: App handles increased visitors without me manually adjusting anything

**Practical Skills for My Resume Project**:
- **App Service Plans**: Understanding the hosting tiers and costs
- **Custom Domains**: How to connect my own domain name to the web app
- **Deployment Sources**: Setting up automatic deployment from my GitHub repo

**What Surprised Me**:
- **Deployment Slots**: Way more powerful than I expected - it's like having multiple versions running simultaneously and toggling between production slots is as easy as clicking a button
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployments whenever I push code changes
- **Scaling Options**: Can scale based on CPU, memory, or even custom metrics

**Business Context**:
This isn't just hosting a website - it's implementing professional DevOps practices that real companies use for production applications.

**Next Steps for Cloud Resume Challenge**:
Now I understand the Azure hosting piece! Still need to learn about Azure Functions for the visitor counter API and Azure CDN for performance.

**Key Insight**: 
Web Apps give me enterprise-grade hosting with professional deployment practices - way beyond basic static site hosting.
