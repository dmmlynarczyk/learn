# Azure Cloud Concepts

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **Cost:** eliminates capital expense.
- **Global scale:** ability to scale elastically.
- **Performance:** computing hardware is always upgraded to the latest generation.
- **Security:** data stored in the cloud has a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls.
- **Speed:** computing resources can be provisioned in minutes.
- **Productivity:** enables the customer to focus on business requirements instead of setting up on-site datacenters.
- **Reliability:** availability of your resources at all times.

## High Availability

- **High Availability:** a quality that allows for services to continue running even if some components fail
- If hardware fails, an exact copy is created and deployed right away
- Uses groups of virtual machines (called *clusters*) to ensure high availability

## Fault Tolerance

- **Fault tolerance:** when you have a copy of your configuration or system in another Azure region that will become your primary system in the event of an outage
