# Cloud Types

## Public Cloud

- **Public Cloud:** owned and operated by the cloud service provider, which deliver computing resources over the public internet
  - All hardware, software, and supporting infrastructure is owned by the cloud service provider
  - This is typically the cheapest cloud model
  - You share cloud resources with other companies/people/services, but they will never mix
  - Think basic Azure, AWS, and more
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model

## Private Cloud

- **Private Cloud:** refers to cloud compute resources that are used exclusively by a single organization, person, or resource
  - You pay for the entire on-premises datacenter environment that your organization uses
  - You will pay for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software
  - Typically used when data cannot be put into the public cloud for legal reasons

## Hybrid Cloud

- **Hybrid Cloud:** a combination of public and private cloud
  - Allows you to keep data off of the public cloud but also utilize resources on the public cloud for performance when needed
  - This means you only pay for the extra computing equipment when you need it the most
