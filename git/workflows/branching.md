# Branching

**Branching:** allows you to branch of code to make new code changes that will only be seen in the new branch you created.  Will not be seen in the Master Branch.

If you are working in a branched workflow, you will only see the code of the main branch up until the point of the branch.
Any changes you made in the Master Branch after the branch will not be visible in the Secondary Branch, and any changes in the Secondary will not be visible in the Master.

Useful because you will be building out new features that might break you code and you do not want to save them to the Master branch and have it fully working before you merge it back into the Master Branch.

Branching also allows you to fix bugs that are in the main code and merge back to push the fix.
